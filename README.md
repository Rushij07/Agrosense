Project: AgroSense - Agricultural Decision-Support System

Developed 'AgroSense', a comprehensive decision-support system designed to optimize agricultural practices using data-driven insights. This innovative project integrated three key applications: Crop Recommendation, Fertilizer Suggestion, and Plant Disease Detection, catering to the diverse needs of the farming community.

Project Features:

Crop Recommendation System: Developed a sophisticated algorithm to recommend optimal crops to farmers based on soil nutrient values (N-P-K ratios), local climate data, and regional agricultural trends. This feature helps in maximizing yield and sustainability by aligning crop choices with environmental conditions.

Fertilizer Suggestion System: Created a model that analyses soil nutrient content and suggests suitable fertilizers for the chosen crops. This system assists farmers in addressing nutrient deficiencies or excesses in their soil, thereby promoting healthier crop growth and reducing environmental impact.

Disease Detection System: Implemented an advanced image processing technique using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify plant diseases from leaf images. This tool aids farmers in early disease detection, providing them with effective treatment solutions, and preventing widespread crop damage.

Impact and Insights:

The system's crop recommendation algorithm successfully achieved a high accuracy rate of 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting suitable crops based on complex environmental and soil parameters.
Through the fertilizer suggestion feature, farmers were able to optimize fertilizer usage, improving soil health and crop productivity while minimizing unnecessary costs and environmental harm.
The disease detection module effectively identified various crop diseases, offering timely intervention strategies, which significantly reduced crop losses and improved overall farm health.
AgroSense played a pivotal role in advancing precision agriculture, providing farmers with a data-centric approach to farming that enhances yield, efficiency, and sustainability.
Technologies Used:

Leveraged Python for data analysis, machine learning model development, and backend functionality.
Utilized TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms.
Implemented a user-friendly web interface for easy access and interaction with the system.
Overall Contribution:

This project highlights my ability to apply data science and machine learning techniques to real-world problems, creating a tangible impact in the agricultural sector. My role encompassed everything from data collection and analysis, model development, to the creation of an interactive user interface, showcasing a blend of technical expertise and a deep understanding of user needs.
